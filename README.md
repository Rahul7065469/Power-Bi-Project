# Power BI
Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool used for transforming raw data into interactive dashboards and insightful reports. It simplifies data visualization and enables data-driven decision-making through its user-friendly interface and advanced features. I have utilized Power BI to analyze and visualize complex datasets, such as sales trends, by creating dynamic reports and dashboards. My projects demonstrate proficiency in data modeling, creating measures using DAX, and integrating external tools like Python to enhance analysis. Power BI is an essential tool for making data accessible and actionable for stakeholders.
